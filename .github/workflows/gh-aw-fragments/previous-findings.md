## Previous Findings

Before filing a new issue, check `/tmp/previous-findings.json` for issues this agent has already filed.

- Run `cat /tmp/previous-findings.json` to read the list of previously filed issue numbers and titles.
- If your finding closely matches an open or recently-closed issue in that list, call `noop` instead of filing a duplicate.
- Only file a new issue when the finding is genuinely distinct from all previous findings.
