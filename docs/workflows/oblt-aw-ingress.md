# Workflow: `oblt-aw-ingress.yml`

## Overview

Source file: [.github/workflows/oblt-aw-ingress.yml](../../.github/workflows/oblt-aw-ingress.yml)

This is the reusable orchestration entrypoint for `oblt-aw`. It routes to specialized workflows based on event context.

## Prerequisites

- Called by consumer workflows using `workflow_call`.
- Optional secret: `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## Usage

### Supported triggers

The workflow file declares only `workflow_call`.

Event triggers such as `schedule`, `workflow_dispatch`, `issues`, `issue_comment`, and `pull_request` are declared in caller workflows/templates (for example [.github/remote-workflow-template/oblt-aw.yml](../../.github/remote-workflow-template/oblt-aw.yml)). In ingress, routing conditions evaluate `github.event_name` and `github.event.action` from the caller event payload.

### Dashboard gating

The job `dashboard-enabled-workflows` runs `get-enabled-workflows.yml` first. Downstream jobs use `needs: dashboard-enabled-workflows` and gate on its outputs:

- `effective-raw` empty (no open dashboard issue) → every registry id is treated as enabled for jobs that check `enabled-workflows`.
- `effective-raw` non-empty and the normalized `enabled-workflows` array is `[]` → no gated jobs run.
- Non-empty `enabled-workflows` → only listed **compound ids** `org:workflow-id` pass the `contains(..., 'org:workflow-id')` checks (for example `obs:agent-suggestions`). Bare workflow ids without an org prefix are not accepted.

Jobs that do not list `needs: dashboard-enabled-workflows` are not gated this way (see [Internal ingress jobs](#internal-ingress-jobs-not-in-workflow-registryjson)).

### PR author allow list (`load-allowed-pr-authors`)

On `pull_request` events only, ingress runs job `load-allowed-pr-authors` (`if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'`), which calls reusable workflow [.github/workflows/load-allowed-pr-authors.yml](../../.github/workflows/load-allowed-pr-authors.yml) in parallel with `dashboard-enabled-workflows`, before `automerge` and `dependency-review`. The reusable workflow **checks out** the public **`elastic/oblt-aw`** repository at `ref=main` (sparse: [config/obs/allowed_pr_authors.json](https://github.com/elastic/oblt-aw/blob/main/config/obs/allowed_pr_authors.json) only; same branch consumers pin with `uses: elastic/oblt-aw/.github/workflows/oblt-aw-ingress.yml@main`), then reads the file with `jq -c` into workflow output `allowed_pr_authors_json`. Gating stays on the ingress job so schedule/issue runs do not clone the repo; other workflows can call `load-allowed-pr-authors.yml` without that `if` (for example `workflow_dispatch`). Consumer repositories do not need a copy of this file on disk for ingress routing.

Canonical registry ids and metadata live per org under `config/<org-key>/workflow-registry.json` (for example [config/obs/workflow-registry.json](../../config/obs/workflow-registry.json)). Ingress `enabled-workflows` entries use **`obs:<registry-id>`** for Observability workflows below.

## Routed workflows ([config/obs/workflow-registry.json](../../config/obs/workflow-registry.json))

The following subsections follow the order of entries in the Observability registry. Each subsection lists the registry fields and the ingress job(s) that honor that id in `enabled-workflows` as **`obs:<id>`**. Where a dedicated routing document exists under [docs/routing/](../routing/), the subsection includes a **Routing** link to it (labels, triggers, and dispatch detail).

### Agent suggestions (registry id `agent-suggestions`, gate `obs:agent-suggestions`)

|-------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| `agent-suggestions` | `gh-aw-agent-suggestions.yml` | `schedule` | Yes — `enabled-workflows` must contain `obs:agent-suggestions` when `effective-raw` is non-empty |

### Automated documentation (registry id `autodoc`)

**Routing:** [Autodoc routing](../routing/autodoc-routing.md)

| Registry field | Value |
|----------------|--------|
| `id` | `autodoc` |

### Automerge (registry id `automerge`)

**Routing:** [Automerge routing](../routing/automerge-routing.md)

| Ingress job | Reusable workflow | Triggers | Dashboard gate |
|-------------|-------------------|----------|----------------|
| `automerge` | `gh-aw-automerge.yml` | `pull_request` `opened` / `synchronize` / `reopened` / `labeled` where PR author is in `load-allowed-pr-authors` output **and** the PR has label `oblt-aw/ai/merge-ready` | Yes — `obs:automerge` |

Forwards `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` to `gh-aw-automerge.yml` for the Copilot-based approval step.

### Dependency review (registry id `dependency-review`)

**Routing:** [Dependency review routing](../routing/dependency-review-routing.md)

| Registry field | Value |
|----------------|--------|
| `id` | `dependency-review` |

| `description` | Analyzes dependency-update PRs from bots, applies merge-ready labels when criteria are met. |

| Ingress job | Reusable workflow | Triggers | Dashboard gate |
|-------------|-------------------|----------|----------------|

This job is separate from registry id `security`: it is PR-time dependency and license review for bot PRs, not the static repo-wide security scan. See [docs/workflows/gh-aw-dependency-review.md](gh-aw-dependency-review.md) and [docs/workflows/security-scanning-ruleset.md](security-scanning-ruleset.md) (complementary workflows SEC-033–SEC-035).

| `description` | Detects potential duplicate issues when a new issue is opened or when the entrypoint is run manually. |

| Ingress job | Reusable workflow | Triggers | Dashboard gate |
|-------------|-------------------|----------|----------------|
| `duplicate-issue-detector` | `gh-aw-duplicate-issue-detector.yml` | `issues` `opened`, or `workflow_dispatch` | Yes — `obs:duplicate-issue-detector` |

### Issue triage (registry id `issue-triage`)

| Ingress job | Reusable workflow | Triggers | Dashboard gate |
|-------------|-------------------|----------|----------------|
| `mention-in-issue` | `gh-aw-mention-in-issue.yml` | `issue_comment` `created` on an issue (not a PR) with comment starting with `/ai`, where `github.event.comment.author_association` is `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, or `COLLABORATOR` | Yes — `obs:mention-in-issue` |

### Security (registry id `security`)

**Routing:** [Security routing](../routing/security-routing.md)

| Registry field | Value |
|----------------|--------|
| `id` | `security` |
| `name` | Security |
| `description` | Runs static security checks on workflows, shell scripts, and dependency manifests per the security scanning ruleset; opens issues for findings. |

## Internal ingress jobs (not in [workflow-registry.json](../../config/obs/workflow-registry.json))

These jobs exist only in [.github/workflows/oblt-aw-ingress.yml](../../.github/workflows/oblt-aw-ingress.yml) and do not have registry ids:

| Job | Role |
|-----|------|
| `dashboard-enabled-workflows` | Invokes `get-enabled-workflows.yml`; supplies `effective-raw` and `enabled-workflows` to gated jobs. See [docs/workflows/get-enabled-workflows.md](get-enabled-workflows.md). |
| `unsupported-trigger` | Runs when the event is not one of the supported combinations; fails the workflow with a clear message. It has no `needs: dashboard-enabled-workflows` and does not read the registry. |

## Configuration

Top-level permissions (matches [.github/workflows/oblt-aw-ingress.yml](../../.github/workflows/oblt-aw-ingress.yml)):

- `actions: write`
- `checks: read`
- `contents: write`
- `discussions: write`
- `id-token: write` (OIDC for nested reusable workflows that use ephemeral tokens, e.g. [gh-aw-security-detector.md](gh-aw-security-detector.md))
- `issues: write`
- `pull-requests: write`

## API / Interface

Interface exposed through `workflow_call`:

- Secret: `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` (`required: false`)

## Examples

Minimal consumer reference (client template calls ingress only; dashboard read runs inside ingress):

```yaml
jobs:
  run-aw:
    uses: elastic/oblt-aw/.github/workflows/oblt-aw-ingress.yml@main
    secrets:
      COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
